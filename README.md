# Intro
This package enables express-based node applications to accept passkeys for verification. It adds four endpoints to an existing express app and handles the entire registration and verification process. You can use own authentication and success functions in order to handle user authentication and user login the way you want to.
The wrapper does currently not allow for specific credential options and therefore allows for a user login solely based on a passkey.
